        Bump the required version of HTTP::Request::Common to the version
        that actually allows us to properly call HTTP::Request::Common::post
        and ...::put.

    [Features]

        New methods LWP::UserAgent::JSON->post_json, put_json and patch_json
        act as the equivalent of LWP::UserAgent->post, ->put and ->patch (if
        it actually implemented a patch method, which it doesn't), but if a
        reference is passed as the parameter after $url, turn it into JSON
        instead of form-encoding it.

        Should handle Unicode better.

        Always sorts output. Modern Perls (5.18+) have arbitrary hash
        key ordering, so whatever JSON was spat out by a previous
        version of your code wouldn't necessarily resemble what you'd
        produce now. The overhead on my system is single digit
        microseconds, so this seems like a reasonable default.

        The methods that create JSON objects have been exposed so you
        can subclass this easily if you want to.

        Make HTTP::Request::JSON->json_content into a mutator, so if
        you say $request->json_content it returns the current content
        as decoded from JSON, rather than unhelpfully setting the content
        to 'null'.

        This needs a version of HTTP::Message that knows about JSON
        properly, at least for the tests.
